These days we are inundated with messages from others. Iâ€™m building an arduino-based teddy bear which lights up when you receive an email from only those people who are closest to you. In its completed phase, this project will be replete with its own web interface where you can login (with oAuth), name the bear, and set the people who are closest to you. Teddy will light up and remind you that your loved ones are thinking of you!
